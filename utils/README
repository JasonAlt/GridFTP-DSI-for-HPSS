dsi_client is intended to be a test program to drive the HPSS DSI as a 
standalone client without the need for the Globus GridFTP server. It does
this by mocking the GridFTP server routines and driving the latest DSI
shared module against your HPSS installation as though it is a 
client/server architecture.

In order to operate dsi_client, you must have all of the requirements of the
deployed DSI *except* configuration details in /etc. You must have 
/var/hpss/etc/gridftp_hpss_dsi.conf and the associated keytab file for
the hpssftp user and these files must be accessible to your current shell
UID. When executing dsi_client, your shell UID must be equal the target
UID in HPSS.

Currently, it supports two commands: 'stat' which behaves like 'ls' and
'stor' which will copy local files into HPSS. The 'stor' command has this
syntax:

dsi_client stor [-l <length> | -c <concurrency> | -b blocksize ] <src_local_file> <dst_hpss_file>

An example execution purposes may be to read from memory and write 30GiB into HPSS:

[user$ ] ./dsi_client stor -l  32212254720 /dev/zero <hpss_target_path>

The -l option specifies the length of the entire transfer, only necessary when reading from devices like /dev/zero. -c specifies the number of simultaneous buffers to use in the transfer. -b specifies the size of each buffer.
