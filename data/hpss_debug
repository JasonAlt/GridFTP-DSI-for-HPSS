#
# This file is used to configure the HPSS connector to perform additional
# logging and testing which is generally only useful for debugging by 
# developers or release testing by endpoint administrators. 
#
# If you are looking for general production logging, see the 'log_level'
# setting, set in /etc/gridftp.d/globus-connect-server-gridftp-logging by
# default. As of version 2.15, the HPSS connector sends it standard logging
# to the GridFTP server's default log file.
#
# See the HPSS connector documentation at docs.globus.org for more information.
#

#
# $GLOBUS_GRIDFTP_SERVER_HPSS_DEBUG
#
# Uncommenting this option will configure the HPSS connector to log extremely
# verbose output to the log file. The format used in these log messages is
# targetted at HPSS connector developers and may change between versions.
#
# The file must exist and be writable by any or all users that you want
# to be able to log information from their GridFTP sessions.
#

#$GLOBUS_GRIDFTP_SERVER_HPSS_DEBUG "ALL,/var/log/hpss_connector_debug.log,1,2"

# 
# $HPSS_API_DEBUG - configures the level of debug information
# $HPSS_API_DEBUG_PATH - configures the file used to store logging
#
# The following two options are used to enable HPSS API debugging in the HPSS
# client libraries. This is a feature of HPSS not the HPSS connector. These are
# provided as a convenience.
#

#$HPSS_API_DEBUG 7
#$HPSS_API_DEBUG_PATH "/var/log/hpss_api.debug"
