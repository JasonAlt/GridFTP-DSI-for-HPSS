Version 1.0 RC2
	- Added fixes sent by Damian Hazen of LBL:
		- Fixed user->home directory mapping to use HPSS LDAP
		- Fixed KRB5 authentication issues
		- Added $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf as new config file location
		- Added gridftp_dsi_hpss_commands.c and header to Makefile.am
	- The search order for the config file is now:
		1) $HPSS_PATH_ETC/gridftp.conf
		2) /var/hpss/etc/gridftp.conf
	- Install directions now include config file setup
	- Fixed config file's AdminList syntax
	- No longer force max segment size in hints
	- Fix for RETR that end early, presumably due to a large segment count

Version 1.0 RC1
	- Now requires Globus Toolkit 5.2.3rc1 or newer. See 
	  http://jira.globus.org/browse/GT-299
	- Added support for ESTO, ERET, REST (APPE, SCKS not supported yet)
	- Tested against HPSS 7.3.3P7
	- Remove libtool from the distribution
	- Added support for MFMT and SITE UTIME
	- Added support for SITE SYMLINKFROM/SYMLINKTO
	- Added symlink targets to list output
	- Added restart and performance markers in extended block mode
	- Added SETCOS,LSCOS (class of service), SETFAM,LSFAM (tape families)
	- Added project, family, cos and admin settings to the config file
	- Changed '250 Success' messages to '250 OK' to match server.
	- Added 'SITE HARDLINKFROM' and 'SITE HARDLINKTO'
	- Added 'SITE STAGE'. Files that can not be staged because they are on a
	  tape-only class of service will give a special warning.
	- Changed calculation for what is and is not archived. A file must be 
	  completely on a disk SC to be considered not archived.
	- Changed "AR" status in list output to "TP". This should better reflect
	  that some COS are tape only.
	- The list function has been removed until a fully functional version
	  including MLSD and NLST can be implemented.
	- Removed project file configs until those are better understood.
	- Split the DSI into local and control/data components
